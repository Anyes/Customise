 Set of [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mods for [Neos](https://neos.com/) that allow you to customize aspects of the Neos UI.
 
# Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Choose what mods you want to use from the list below and place the mod/s into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
